# E-NER Dataset


The dataset contains 52 filings from the US SEC EDGAR database. The named entity tags are hand annotated. 

The named entities are classified into 7 classes: Person, Court, Business, Government, Location, Legislation/Act, Miscellaneous (and the class "Outside" for non-named entities).
The "all.csv" contains the annotated filings, with 1 token on each line, followed by the named entity tag. The token and named entity tag is separated by a tab.

The "edgar_4.csv" contains the same data as "all.csv", but there are only 4 named entity classes: Person, Organization, Location and Miscellaneous. (Court, Business and Government combined into Organization, and Legislation/Act and Miscellaneous combined into Miscellaneous)
